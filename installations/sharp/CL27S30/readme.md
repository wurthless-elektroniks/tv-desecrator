# Sharp CL27S30

Consumer grade TV with S-Video, two video inputs, and picture-in-picture.

Tube: Thomson A68ADT25X-06 (shadow mask)

Points of interest:
- C804 = red capacitor
- C805 = green capacitor
- C806 = blue capacitor
- Jumper 417 = blanking from MICOM to jungle IC
- C408 = 7 volts smoothing cap

Switchless operation still TODO.
