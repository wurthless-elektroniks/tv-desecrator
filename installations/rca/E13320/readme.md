# RCA E13320

Lovely 13" slot mask TV from RCA.

Tube: 37GDA86X (slot mask)

Points of interest:
- CV505, CV507, CV509 are the RGB caps
- RR40: Red channel TTL-to-0.7V dropdown resistor
- RR39: Green channel TTL-to-0.7V dropdown resistor
- RR38: Blue channel TTL-to-0.7V dropdown resistor
- RR41: Blanking resistor

Switchless operation only possible via sync comparison or I2C snooping.
